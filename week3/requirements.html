            <h4> Web Accessibility National Transition Strategy (NTS) </h4>
            <p> In 2010, Australian Government released its Web Accessibility National Transition Strategy (NTS), which endorsed the adoption and implementation of WCAG 2.0. Designed to deliver improved web services across government, the NTS paved the way for a more technically accessible environment in which people could access information and engage with government. </p>

            <p> The NTS stipulated that all government websites (federal, state and territory) had to meet a minimum of WCAG 2.0 Level A compliance by the end of 2012. Furthermore, Federal Government websites had to meet a minimum of WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliance by the end of 2014. Overall, to support a national transition, the aim was for all governments to achieve WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliance by early 2015. These requirements were outlined in the Australian Government's Web Guide, which has since been superseded by the Digital Service Standard. </p>

            <h4> Digital Service Standard (DSS) </h4>
            <p> In 2015, the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) became responsible for whole-of-government web guidance, which resulted in the launch of their <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/"> Digital Service Standard (DSS) </a>. The DTO then became part of a newly formed <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/"> Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) </a> in October 2016, which was established to guide, oversee and drive the Government's ambitious digital and ICT agendas, including the DSS. </p>

            <p> With a strong emphasis on user-centred design and inclusive services, the DSS establishes the criteria that all Australian digital government services must meet to ensure they are technically compliant against WCAG 2.0, as well as simpler, faster and easier for everyone to use. Government services will be assessed against the DSS if their design or redesign commenced after 6 May 2016. </p>

            <p> Accessibility requirements are specifically addressed in Criterion 9: Make it Accessible, which states that agencies need to make sure everyone who needs their service can use it, including people with disabilities and older people. Under Criterion 9, it is required that accessibility be addressed at every stage, from planning to development to delivery of a digital service. Guidance on making content accessible and testing web accessibility for websites, online services and mobile apps is available. </p>

            <h3 id="documents"> Document accessibility </h3>
            <p> Often an area of some confusion, let's delve into document accessibility requirements. </p>

            <h4> Portable Document Format (PDF) </h4>
            <p> PDF accessibility is covered under W3C WAI's PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0. However, due to the lack of support for PDF in mobile environments, it is still not considered an independent accessible format. This means that although PDFs can be made fully accessible to WCAG 2.0 standards, it may still be necessary to provide the same information in another format, ideally HTML. </p>

            <h4> Microsoft Word documents </h4>
            <p> Although Word documents can be optimised for accessibility, they aren't covered under WCAG 2.0. This means that if you publish a Word document to a website, it is necessary for you to provide the same information in another format that complies with WCAG 2.0. </p>

            <p> So, why is it still important to learn how to create accessible Word documents? Because often a Word document is just the start of a bigger process. A Word document might be converted to HTML or PDF; it might be published to a website as an attachment; it might be emailed to a colleague or customer with a disability; it might be passed on to a group of people whose abilities you're not sure of. You need to ensure the document you've created is fit for possible conversion or distribution.
            </p>

            <h4> Document format usage situations </h4>
            <p> We recommend using the following situations as a guide to publishing documents online: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> If a PDF is accessible to WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards, and it is highly likely to be accessed from a desktop computer with appropriate accessibility support, it should be accompanied by a HTML cover page. </li>
                <li> If a PDF is accessible to WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards, but is likely to be accessed from a mobile device, it should be accompanied by a compliant HTML alternative or accessible Word document. </li>
                <li> If a PDF is not accessible to WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards, it must be accompanied by a compliant HTML alternative. </li>
                <li> If a Word document has been optimised for accessibility, it must be accompanied by a compliant PDF or HTML alternative. </li>
                <li> If a Word document has not been optimised for accessibility, it must be accompanied by a compliant HTML alternative. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="AUSorganisations"> Accessibility requirements for all Australian organisations </h3>
            <h4> United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities </h4>
            <p> The <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html"> UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities </a> recognises access to information and communications technologies, including the web, as a basic human right. </p>

            <p> To enable people with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, all Australian organisations are required to take appropriate measures to ensure access to information and communications by identifying and eliminating obstacles and barriers to accessibility. </p>

            <h4> Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) </h4>
            <p> Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA), the Australian Human Rights Commission released its <a href="https://www.humanrights.gov.au/world-wide-web-access-disability-discrimination-act-advisory-notes-ver-41-2014"> World Wide Web Access: Disability Discrimination Act Advisory Notes </a>[ | ], which provides information about accessibility and legal issues, as well as advice about how web designers and website owners can minimise the possibility of disability discrimination. Requirements under the DDA apply to any individual or organisation developing a website or other web resource in Australia, or placing or maintaining a web resource on an Australian server. </p>

            <p> Complaints are made to the Commission for breaches of the DDA. In considering a disability discrimination complaint about web accessibility, the Commission takes into consideration the extent to which the best available advice on accessibility has been obtained and followed. A complaint is much less likely to succeed if reasonable steps have been taken to address accessibility during the design stage. </p>

            <h4> ICT Procurement Standard </h4>
            <p> Australia has established a minimum standard for the procurement of accessible ICT, which will support access to ICT for people with disabilities and provide ICT procurers with much-needed accessibility guidance and certainty. </p>

            <p> Driven by Standards Australia in conjunction with the Department of Finance, the new Australian Standard is a direct adoption of European Standard EN 301 549: "Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe". </p>

            <p> A demonstration of Australia's commitment to accessible technology, the Standard will ensure ICT products and services can be used by everyone, including those with disability or impairment. </p>

            <p> Due to be ratified at the end of 2016, the Standard can be used by the public and private sectors as a framework to determine the technical specifications for the procurement of accessible ICT, such as websites, software, digital devices, documents and support services. </p>
